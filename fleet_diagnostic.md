Fleet Diagnostic Module:
This module focuses on real-time tracking, diagnostic analytics, and predictive maintenance
for fleet vehicles. It leverages IoT telemetry data (engine health, temperature, GPS, fuel level)
and integrates with AWS IoT Core and Bedrock-based AI agents to alert for anomalies, 
generate insights, and reduce downtime.
